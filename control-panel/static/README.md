# Frontend for the control panel

Can be run anywhere but dont forget to adjust the url to the backend

It can be run using any http server.
I use the one built in with python.

```python
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

This server will serve files from the current directory on your machine and make them accessible on your network at port 8080.
